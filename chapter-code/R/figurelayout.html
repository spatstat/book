## Auxiliary script figurelayout

The auxiliary script `figurelayout.R` below is loaded by the R code at the start of every chapter. The code assumes that the script is placed in a subdirectory `R` of the current working directory. You can download the script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/book/gh-pages/_includes/chapter-code/R/figurelayout.R">here</a>.

{% include chapter-code/R/figurelayout.R %}
