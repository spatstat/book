## Auxiliary script startup
The auxiliary script `startup.R` below is loaded in the R code for all chapters.
The chapter R code assumes that the script is placed in a subdirectory 'R' of the current working directory.
You can download the script <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/book/gh-pages/_includes/chapter-code/R/startup.R">here</a>.

{% highlight r %}
{% include chapter-code/R/startup.R %}
