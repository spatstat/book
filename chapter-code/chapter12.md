## R code for chapter 12
Below is the R code used to generate results and figures in chapter 12.
The code is in a rather raw format extracted from the book manuscript files -- please read the [instructions for use](../chapter-code.html) if you haven't done so yet.
You can download the script <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spatstat/book/gh-pages/_includes/chapter-code/12clustercox.R' target=_blank>here</a>.

{% highlight r %}
{% include chapter-code/12clustercox.R %}
{% endhighlight %}
