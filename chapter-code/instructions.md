## Instructions for chapter code usage

For each chapter a script is provided which generates all results and figures of that chapter.
Most of the commands can simply be copy and pasted into an R session where spatstat is loaded.
However, several chunks of code require that one or more auxiliary R scripts have been loaded first.
To be able to run all chapter scripts from the current working directory it must contain a subdirectory called 'R' containing the following files:

- [startup.R](R/startup.html) (required by all chapters)
- [fijiquakes.R](R/fijiquakes.html) (required by chapter 6)
- [rSpecialMC.R](R/rSpecialMC.html) (required by chapter 12)
- [rSpecialNS.R](R/rSpecialNS.html) (required by chapter 12)
- [short.output](R/short.output.html) (required by chapter 16-17)
- [shortestpath.R](R/shortestpath.html) (required by chapter 17)

The code for each chapter is here: 

- [Chapter 1](chapter01.html)
- [Chapter 2](chapter02.html)
- [Chapter 3](chapter03.html)
- [Chapter 4](chapter04.html)
- [Chapter 5](chapter05.html)
- [Chapter 6](chapter06.html)
- [Chapter 7](chapter07.html)
- [Chapter 8](chapter08.html)
- [Chapter 9](chapter09.html)
- [Chapter 10](chapter10.html)
- [Chapter 11](chapter11.html)
